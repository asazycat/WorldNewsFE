## 📰 World News - (Early Stages)

World News is a sources of news articles from many different news outlets (BBC, New York Times, MSN..etc) accross the globe. It is an archieve built with endpoints from WorldNewsAPI(https://worldnewsapi.com/docs/). NextJS is used to build the frontend artitecture along with Materials UI and some tailwind CSS for styling. API calls from WorldNewsAPI are limited and won't go beyond 50 tokens. In order to tackle this problem, api responses were otherwise cached to reduce fetch requests directly from WorldsNewsAPU or pushed to an ORM to reduce request count.
